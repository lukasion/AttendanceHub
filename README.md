- **Leave & Vacation Management** - Request and approve leave directly in the app. View available vacation days, and manage sick leaves and personal time off. Customizable leave policies for different teams or departments. Track leave history and balance for each employee.
- **Attendance & Leave Reports** - Generate daily, weekly, or monthly reports on attendance, absenteeism, and leave balance. Export reports to CSV or PDF formats for easy sharing with HR or management. Visual analytics (charts/graphs) to analyze attendance trends and improve workforce efficiency.
- **Automated Alerts & Notifications** - Send automated reminders for late check-ins or missed shifts. Notifications for upcoming leave requests and pending approvals. Alert managers about unusual patterns like frequent absenteeism.
- **Team Dashboard & Presence Overview** - A team overview dashboard to view whoâ€™s clocked in, on leave, or out sick in real-time. Easy access to current team availability for better workload distribution.
